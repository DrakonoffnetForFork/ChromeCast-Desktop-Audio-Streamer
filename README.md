# ChromeCast Desktop Audio Streamer

This tool captures the audio from your desktop and streams it to a ChromeCast Audio device.

You can download an installer from the 'Releases' folder.

After install there are some options you can set in the config file in the install folder. Also when your device is not automatically discovered you can add it there.

It's inspired by this tool: https://github.com/acidhax/chromecast-audio-stream, and has basically the same functionality.
